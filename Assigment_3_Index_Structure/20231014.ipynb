      "  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily\n",
      "  determined by their email address in the sense that this is their\n",
      "  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your\n",

      "  for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see\n",

      "  forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.\n",
      "\n",
      "  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message\n",
      "  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This\n",
      "  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the\n",
      "  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This\n",
      "  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET\n",
      "  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires\n",

      "  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the\n",
      "  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked\n",
      "  at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be\n",

      "<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?\n",
      "\n",
      "  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,\n",
      "  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of\n",
      "  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication\n",
      "  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for\n",
      "  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity\n",
      "  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive\n",
      "  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can\n",
      "  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',\n",
      "  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is\n",
      "  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled\n",
      "  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was\n",
      "  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and\n",
      "  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their\n",
      "  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of\n",
      "  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is\n",
      "  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he\n",
      "  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular\n",
      "  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally\n",
      "  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many\n",
      "  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better\n",
      "  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more\n",
      "  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it\n",
      "  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the\n",
      "  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in\n",
      "  exerting pressure for acceptance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating\n",
      "  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. \n",
      "  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques\n",
      "  for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital\n",
      "  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. \n",
      "  Many government functions and services are based on identification,\n",
      "  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of\n",
      "  many government organizations push toward stronger identification\n",
      "  structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?\n",

      "  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive\n",
      "  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect\n",
      "  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly\n",
      "  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or\n",

      "Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \n",
      "traditional therapies. \n",
      "     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \n",
      "been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \n",
      "available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \n",
      "significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \n",
      "and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \n",
      "unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \n",
      "Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \n",
      "be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \n",
      "fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \n",
      "proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \n",
      "the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \n",

      "introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \n",
      "tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \n",
      "occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \n",

      "expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \n",
      "program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \n",
      "substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \n",
      "patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \n",
      "a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \n",
      "general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \n",

      "and the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \n",
      "     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \n",
      "environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \n",
      "January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \n",

      "embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \n",
      "This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \n",
      "success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \n",
      "issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \n",
      "by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \n",
      "both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \n",
      "should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \n",

      "is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \n",

      "combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \n",

      "     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \n",
      "percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \n",
      "relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \n",
      "Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \n",
